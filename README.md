# This repository and old EBI framework is not supported anymore, please update your websites to use new Visual Framework - https://stable.visual-framework.dev/


# Framework v1.2 beta coming soon
The EBI Visual Framework v1.2 is under active development and will enter beta testing in May. [Learn more about v1.2](https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Framework/tree/v1.2)

# EBI-Framework

This, the EBI Visual Framework, is the successor to the current EBI Compliance Theme. Homed here are the various assets that make the EBI Visual Framewok (CSS, JS, and a few images and build scripts).

## Where do I start? How do I use this?

1. Quick start:
  - see the [HTML demos in the EBI Pattern Library /sample-site directory](https://ebiwd.github.io/EBI-Pattern-library/sample-site/).
2. Test for compatibility:
  - if you're migrating an exsisting site [try out the in-browser migration JS](https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Pattern-library/blob/gh-pages/sample-site/migrations/testMigration.js).
3. Import legacy style and grids:
  - if you're not able to immediately move away from the exsisting omega grid, or some of the old popular or intro boxes [try loading the legacy CSS](https://ebi.emblstatic.net/web_guidelines/EBI-Framework/v1.1/css/compliance-legacy-compatibility.css).
4. Guidance:
  - For the updated web guidelines, [check out the pattern library](https://ebiwd.github.io/EBI-Pattern-library/) for guidance on making your site look proper and correct.
5. Help!
  - Check out the [issue queue](https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Framework/issues) or contact [Ken Hawkins](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/ken-hawkins) on the Web Development team.

### Do I need to download this?

No. The vast majority of users should link to the EBI hosted files. You'll load three CSS files, seven JS files, and use a wrapper HTML. Have a look at the source of [the simple boilerplate page] (https://ebiwd.github.io/EBI-Pattern-library/sample-site/boilerplate/blank.html).

## About the framework

The project is an evolution of the 2013 EBI Compliance Theme, updating visual styles to better match EMBL-EBI print colours and text, modern web design best practices -- such as responsive design, and to move to a versioned framework for improved maintenance cycles.

The first release is v1.1 -- the current EBI Compliance Theme is the v1.0. Version 1.2 will follow six months after this is released.

This project continues efforts of the existing guidance by providing:

- Modularisation of framework components that will:
  - Require fewer roll-your-own solutions
  - Be more robust out of the box
  - Standardisation of tooling
- Project themes: colour palettes are now themes with flexible spacing, layout options
  - Sync styles and colour palette with corporate EMBL-EBI styles
- Update visual assets to make use of contemporary web browser features for:
  - More consistency with print visual language
  - Enhanced mobile support
- Pattern library for reusable components to speed development and reduce fragmentation (in progress, more targeted for 1.2 release)
  - Page-specific header colours and images through metatags: meta-background-image, meta-background-color
  - Built in [pattern support through Foundation Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/grid.html)
- Page lifecycle tracking: An improved meta-tag based model for maintaining and tracking content freshness, ownership, and intent
- Regular updates: A versioning system for the framework to help track changes, features, and usage
  - Sass support (optional)
  - NPM updating (optional)
- Collaboration: A more collaborative code base (note this is on GitHub) to offer a better path for code collaboration and integration

## Outreach
Not all developers are in the same place, so we plan to make use of multiple channels:

- Github: Many developers already live in the Github ecosystem, engaging them here will also fit well into the pull request/issue queue ecosystem.
- Web Guidelines Committee: Not only does this facilitate exposure, but is an active forum for peer review.
- Slack: A strong space for communication that can happen even in distributed teams.
- Clinics: An offline space for developers to chat in depth, current thinking is to run in parallel with External Relations' monthly content clinics.
   - Pattern library workshops: While separate from the core framework, it is interdependent
- Showing: Launching the corporate site in the new framework will not only increase awareness but also lead by example.

With the exception of clinics, all of these can be ongoing support/outreach efforts. Recommend the clinics continue as long as there is interest.

## Versioning
As not all users of the framework will be able to update to the very latest and we do not wish to hold others back, we are using a semantic versioning style of releases.

| Major release | Minor release | Note |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---- |
| (Branch)      | (Tag)         | |
| 1.1           | .0            | Initial release evolving from Compliance theme |
| "             | .1            | Tagged minor release |
| "             | .2            | Tagged minor release |
| "             | .3            | Tagged minor release |
| 1.2           | .0            | Documented, breaking release |
| "             | .1            | Tagged minor release |
| 1.3           | .0            | Documented, breaking release |

Difference between major, minor releases:
- Major releases (1.1, 1.2, 1.3...) can have breaking changes and any such changes will be detailed and tested.
- Minor releases (0.0.X) will not have changes to code structure or parts and will mainly add features or update visual assets (such as logos or icon fonts).


The support for previous major versions (branches) is still being considered, but the current suggestion is that the last three major version will be supported with updates to assets, fonts, and critical EMBl and EBI branding.

Where's version 1.0, you ask? Version 1.0 is the [current EBI Compliance theme](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/web_guidelines/html/compliance/).

### Test releases
Testing releases will be identified in their tag, a la: `V1.1.0-alpha`, where `.0-alpha` is the tag. `-alpha`, `-beta` and `-dev` are the anticipated tag suffixes.

### Variant releases
There are no officially supported variant, however a "lite" version is being considered. With the branch of `v1.1-lite`.

### Deployment
Files are hosted in this pattern:
```
//ebi.emblstatic.net/web_guidelines/[repo-name]/[branch]/[repo-files]
```
That is:
```
//ebi.emblstatic.net/web_guidelines/EBI-Framework/v1.1/js/script.js
```

### Building from NPM
We expect the vast majority of users to link to the built CSS and JS files (as shown in the sample HTML files), however some teams may want to download the EBI Framework and modify it for performance or deeper appearance issues.

We've configured the system to build with NPM (no need for gulp or bower).

To get started, have a look at `package.json`. Likely the the `npm run scss` command will cover 90% of use cases.

## Roadmap
- v1.2: Guidance and templates for wide-screen content engagements;
        Use the masthead image as a skybox promo/feature
- v1.4: Unit testing
- v1.5: Add animation guidance and tooling ([see this](https://medium.com/@vlh/what-does-disney-know-about-interface-animation-anyway-86b32d01bc4a))
